      title: "Quantum linear algebra and its applications"
      description: "As we approach the limitations of classical hardware scaling, the development of quantum computing provides the next leap in computational capability. Quantum linear algebra explores efficient methods based on the principles of quantum mechanics, which is intrinsically linear, and applies them to real-world applications, like machine learning, optimization, and chemistry."
